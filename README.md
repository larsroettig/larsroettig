### Hi there,

I develop Magento Projects as Software Engineer at TechDivision GmbH.Over 9 years of development experience working with different clients over the world. 
As Magento PWA Studio Maintainer i try help with any problem or feature request.
In my Free time I really like to bask in natureâ€™s glory right here in the south of Bavaria. 
I also like cycling, hiking or sometimes just relax somewhere to free the mind and gain new ideas.
